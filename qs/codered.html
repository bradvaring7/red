  <h1>📝 CODE RED PROTOCOLS</h1>
  <hr style="border: 1px solid #00ff6e;">

  <p>🚨 "Code Red" scenarios are considered serious or highly escalated customer situations. Whenever we encounter any of these scenarios with a customer, we should promptly fill out the Code Red Form to ensure it is appropriately addressed and follow the correct steps for resolution.</p>
  <hr style="border: 1px solid #00ff6e;">
  <h2>📝 Steps to Submit a Code Red</h2>

  <h3>🛠️ De-escalation Methods/Offers Used</h3>
